- Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+O: New chat

- Alt+1-9: Quick-switch between chats
- Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+? to see all shortcuts

Default Model Selection
Automatically switch to your preferred model (Flash, Thinking, or Pro) on every chat. No more manually selecting your favorite model each time.

Omnibox Quick Launch

## Permission Justifications

| Permission | Justification |
|------------|---------------|
| `activeTab` | Required to inject content scripts into the current Gemini tab when the user interacts. This is the most privacy-respecting way to access page content - it only works on the active tab when triggered by user action. |
| `scripting` | Required to programmatically inject CSS and JS for features like wider chat layout, floating export button, and keyboard shortcuts. Cannot be avoided for content script functionality. |
| `storage` | Required to persist user preferences (which features are enabled, default model choice) across browser sessions using chrome.storage.sync. No external servers - all data stays in the browser. |

### Host Permission
| Host | Justification |
|------|---------------|
| `https://gemini.google.com/*` | The extension only works on Google Gemini. This narrow scope means it cannot access any other websites, protecting user privacy. |
